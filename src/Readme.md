# Getting started

## Dependencies
* Node.js
* npm

## Running the app

1. Open Terminal and browse to the root directory of this test
2. Do an `npm install` to download dependencies
3. Run `grunt connect` in a terminal window.
4. Open your favourite browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/ if it hasn't already

## Notes
* Tools used: jQuery, Grunt, jasmine
* Supported browser: Google Chrome, Firefox & IE8+
* Unfortunately, seem to be having issues with jasmine-jquery loading fixtures :(

## My next steps, given the time...

* Sort out unit tests properly
* Use a test coverage tool like Istanbul to ensure that every function, line and statement is covered by unit testing
* Use a proper framework like  Backbone.js to avoid the jquery spaghetti
* Attempted another JS pattern
* Unsubscribe from all the listerners etc
